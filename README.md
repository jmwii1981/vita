# Vita

## Why?

From a purpose-driven standpoint, [_Vita_](https://janmichael.io) is a landing page for my personal curriculum vita. I initially created _Vita_ to link out to different social media channels because (1) it's great for SEO to link in both directions (try Googling 'Jan Michael Wallace', and see if this site is a top hit), and (2) I thought I'd let those channels do the heavy lifting in showcasing media feeds that demonstrate my talents.

## For what reason?

Creatively, _Vita_ is meant to be a fun nod to a great one-line ad, featuring the text ... **"Take me to your end user,"** with a blinking cursor, depicting the likeness of a computer screen, and a nod to some old-school sci-fi movies ... think "follow the white rabbit," and, "take me to your _leader_." This is to illustrate my passion for user-centric design (and obviously people).

## Who's to say?

Lastly, _Vita_ is always in "flux." I leverage this project as a way of keeping my skills sharp. From a code standpoint, _Vita_ currently interfaces with ...

 - [LastFM API](https://www.last.fm/api)
 - [Open Weather API](https://openweathermap.org/api)
 - [Open Library API](https://openlibrary.org/developers/api)
 - [Github API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest)

... all to track real-time data about me, including the current music I'm listening to, weather in my area (via what shoes and jacket I might be wearing, etc.), and what I'm currently reading. _Vita_ always tells you how many commits it's taken to build it to date, and I plan to add more features over time, as ideas come to me (there are a few below). If you take a look at the codebase in the [JavaScript directory](https://github.com/jmwii1981/vita/tree/main/javascript), you'll see that all of this has been written in a modularly succinct way with modern JavaScript best practices and syntax.

## Future ideas ...
 - Geolocation tracking (trying to decide if I really want people to have the ability to follow my coordinates, call me paranoid :-0)
 - Medium API interfacing (once I get some content up .. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯)
 - Making the landing page look more like a screen with some CSS styling, and having, "Take me to your end user, " type itself out in an animation upon initial load

 ... when will this happen? Who's to say?
