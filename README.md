# Vita

## Why?

From a purpose-driven standpoint, [_Vita_](https://janmichael.io) is a landing page for my personal curriculum vita. I initially created _Vita_ to link out to different social media channels because (1) it's great for SEO to link in both directions ([try Googling 'Jan Michael Wallace'](https://www.google.com/search?q=jan+michael+wallace&rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS817US817&oq=jan+michael+wallace&aqs=chrome.0.69i59j0i22i30j69i60j69i61l2j69i65l3.5263j1j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8), and see if this site is a top hit ... or at least close, depending on your algorithm), and (2) I thought I'd let those channels do the heavy lifting in showcasing media feeds that demonstrate my talents.

## For what reason?

Creatively, _Vita_ is meant to be a fun nod to a great one-line ad, featuring the text ... **"Take me to your end user,"** with a blinking cursor, depicting the likeness of a computer screen, and a nod to some old-school sci-fi movies ... think "follow the white rabbit," and, "take me to your _leader_." The message illustrates my passion for user-centric design ... and humor.

## Who's to say?

Lastly, _Vita_ is always in "flux." I leverage this project as a way of keeping my skills sharp. Most recently, from a code standpoint, _Vita_ interfaces with a variety of APIs ...

 - [LastFM API](https://www.last.fm/api)
 - [Open Weather API](https://openweathermap.org/api)
 - [Open Library API](https://openlibrary.org/developers/api)
 - [Github API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest)

... all to track real-time data about me, including the current music I'm listening to, weather in my area (via what shoes and jacket I might be wearing, etc.), and what I'm currently reading. _Vita_ always tells you how many commits it's taken to build it to date, and I plan to add more features over time, as ideas come to me (there are a few below). If you take a look at the codebase in the [JavaScript directory](https://github.com/jmwii1981/vita/tree/main/javascript), you'll see that all of this has been written in a modularly succinct way with modern JavaScript best practices and syntax. You may notice that I've achieved the following ...

 - Arrays and other objects are used to store and retrieve information that is displayed on the page.
 - Data that is stored in arrays and objects, is analyzed and displays information about it in your app.
 - Factory and data-retrieval functions that accepts two or more input parameters and returns a value that is calculated or determined by the data from an API
 - Data that is easily consumed by its audience (via text which can be read by a screen reader)
 - Data retrieved from a third-party API and used it to display something.


## To the Future And Beyond!
 - Making the landing page look more like a screen with some CSS styling, and having, "Take me to your end user, " type itself out in an animation upon initial load
 - Medium API output to display my most recent article once I get some content up .. ¯!\_(ツ)_/¯
 - Geo-location tracking (trying to decide if I really want people to have the ability to follow my coordinates, call me paranoid :-0)

 ... when will this happen? [Who's to say?](https://youtu.be/m-ugwoEOMvg?t=807)
