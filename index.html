				<h2>Making the dream work.</h2>
				<p>I'm currently leading a brilliant multi-disciplinary team that is ushering in the next generation of our most innovative FinTech Product yet at Heartland, a Global Payments company.</p>
				<p>Both communication and collaboration have been keys in my leadership style, and I believe in the people that I work with. Without a great team, there is not great product.</p>

				<h2>Leaning into the hustle.</h2>
				<p>I am just as passionate about the quality of a project as I am about getting that project launched. And to hit those targets, I believe in effective planning, teamwork, humility, vulnerability, a listening ear, and offering my team the resources they need to be successful.</p>
				<p>I come to the office to play hard, get things done, and have a little fun while doing it!</p>
