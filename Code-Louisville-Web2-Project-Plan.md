# Project Plan

I'd like to create a "fun" page or section attached to my current portfolio site (https://janmichael.io) that ...
 - interfaces with the LastFM API, open weather API, Google Maps API, and GoodReads API
 - to track my real-time IRL current listening (music), weather in my area, my general (not specific) location, and what I'm currently reading
 
 This web App will need access to external APIs and the data will need to be analyzed before it's displayed in the way I would like it to be. I will also include text that checks when the data mentioned above was last updated and displayed. Time permitting, I may rewrite my personal portfolio site in the React framework.
