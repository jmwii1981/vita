# Vita TODO

- [ ] Switch out light and dark mode color styles
- [ ] Implement 
    - Having, "Take me to your end user, " type itself out in an animation upon initial load
    - After initial type animation ... add this glitch animation ... [Text glitch animations](https://codepen.io/aldrie/pen/PojGYLo)
- [ ] Adjust the landing page styling to look more like an old school computer screen 
- [ ] Medium API output to display my most recent article once I get some content up ..
 - [ ] **TBD:** Geo-location tracking _(trying to decide if I really want people to have the ability to follow my coordinates unless I can find a public API (no auth needed) that will abstract them)_
